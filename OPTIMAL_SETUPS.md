71.4% win rate at 03:00 UTC vs 40.1% overall.  
**Action:** Set alerts for early UTC hours.

### 3. Thursday is Cursed

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Immediate Wins (Easy)
1. ✅ Stop trading on Thursdays (+10% WR improvement)
2. ✅ Focus on top 5 coins only (AVAX, FET, STORJ, LIT, DOGE)
3. ✅ Only trade 01:00-03:00 UTC and 15:00 UTC

**Expected Impact:** +20-25% win rate improvement

### Phase 2: Risk Management (Medium)
1. ✅ Implement tighter stop losses (< 1%)
2. ✅ Filter for R:R 1.0-2.0 only
3. ✅ Adjust position sizing for tighter SL

**Expected Impact:** Additional +5-10% win rate

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Hard)
1. ✅ Build alert system for specific combinations
2. ✅ Track seasonal performance monthly
3. ✅ Backtest with ultra-filtered rules on new data

**Expected Impact:** Consistency and refinement

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNINGS

1. **Sample Size:** Some combinations have only 3-5 signals. Monitor performance.
2. **Overfitting Risk:** 100% WR setups may regress to mean with more data.
3. **Market Conditions:** Past performance ≠ future results.
4. **Signal Scarcity:** Ultra-filtering means very few trades (1-2% of signals).
5. **Execution:** Need discipline to skip non-optimal setups.

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ **Test on New Data:** Validate with next 100-200 signals
2. ✅ **Build Alerts:** Create notifications for optimal setups only
3. ✅ **Track Performance:** Log results of filtered vs unfiltered
4. ✅ **Refine Rules:** Adjust thresholds based on live performance
5. ✅ **Paper Trade:** Test ultra-selective strategy before risking capital

---

## 🎓 CONCLUSION

The analysis reveals **massive edge potential** through selective filtering:

✅ **Base Strategy (All Signals):** 40.1% WR  
✅ **Optimized Strategy (Filtered):** 77.8% WR  
✅ **Improvement:** +37.7 percentage points!

**The secret isn't finding MORE signals—it's being SELECTIVE about which signals to trade.**

Focus on:
- Top 5 coins (AVAX, FET, STORJ, LIT, DOGE)
- Early UTC hours (01:00-03:00)
- Tighter stop losses (< 1%)
- Avoid Thursdays and summer months

**Trade less, win more.** 🎯
